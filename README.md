The Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data script offers a comprehensive approach to analyzing sentiments expressed in tweets related to various airlines. By utilizing Python and several key libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy, nltk, re, and sklearn, this codebase processes tweet data from the provided Tweets.csv dataset. Users can clone the repository, install required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file, and download necessary NLTK data to get started. Upon running the sentiment_analysis.py script, the code performs diverse tasks, including exploratory data analysis, text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, training and evaluating multiple machine learning models (such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Multi-layer Perceptron classifiers), and displaying classification reports and accuracy scores for each model. This script serves as a valuable resource for understanding sentiment analysis techniques applied to social media data, specifically tweets related to airlines.
